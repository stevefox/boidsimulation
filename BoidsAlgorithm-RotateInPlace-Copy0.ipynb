      "# SYSM 6302 Final Project: The Boids Algorithm\n",
      "## [Steve Fox](http://www.stevefox.io) \n",
      "\n",
      "The *Boids Algorithm* is a mathematical model of flocking behavior. The flocking behavior of fish, birds and [stampedes of animals (as in Disney's *The Lion King*)](http://www.lionking.org/movies/Stampede.mov) [4] can be simulated using a simple distributed computational paradigm where each actor in the flock responds only to its local surrounding. The original application of the boids algorithm was for animation (computer graphics), but the literature of output synchronization of systems with localized perception, such as mobile robots, is growing (cite papers). \n",
      "\n",
      "Consider how you, too, may be a boid in a crowd. How do people behave at a concert, or waiting in line for a crowded public event? The average person might try to maintain a small space between him or her and the others, to avoid being jostled around. That person will also try to keep the same speed as those around them: if he slows down too much, you might get trampled; if he goes too fast, he will be jostling the people around him. Further, anybody who is anybody wants to be in the center of the crowd, because the center of the crowd is where anybody who's anybody is. It is simple economics: that's the best place to be (for, perhaps, tangible or intangible reasons). In a natural flock, the center of the flock might be *safer* from predators. Finally, there may be some selfish or globally minded goal-oriented behavior: get to the front of the stage first, or get the best patch of grass when the venue opens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Craig W. Reynolds published a paper in July of 1987 titled \"Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model\" describing this behavior for the first time for efficient animation of crowds and flocks. [1] The intent of the paper was to share a computationally feasible method of rendering flocks for computer-generated animations. The computational complexity along with the difficult nature of specifying exact individual paths in large \"flocks\" (of people, animals, etc...) served as an impetus to explore a more feasible means of simulating the type of behavior exhibited by groups of objects. The boids algorithm is described very succinctly in [Steve Strogatz's](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/) [Ted Talk on Syncrhonization in Nature](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_strogatz_on_sync.html) with footage of flocks of birds and schools of fish found in nature (and majestic music in the background). \n",

      "_Boids_ (definition): The word _boid_ is short for _bird-oid_, or a \"bird-like object\". A _flock_ of boids is one whose emergent behavior displays the characteristics of natural flocks, herds and schools of animals. Simulating these behavioral characteristics is based on three local navigation rules for each _boid_ in the flock:\n",
